CRVR is a project that explores the basics of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and its role in the World Wide Web. This project involves building a simple HTTP server using C/C++. The server can handle requests from web browsers, process them, and send back web pages. It supports essential HTTP methods like GET, POST, and DELETE, and includes features for managing file uploads, executing CGI scripts, and serving static websites. Designed to be resilient and compatible with modern web browsers, CRVR aims to provide a hands-on understanding of how web servers work and communicate over the internet.
